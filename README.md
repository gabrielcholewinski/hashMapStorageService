# hashMapStorageService

The overall goal of the project is to realize a service for storing key-value pairs (along the lines of the java.util.Map interface of the Java API) similar to that used by Amazon to support its Web services. In this sense, the data structures used to store this information are a simple chained list and a hash table, given their high search efficiency.
